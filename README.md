# ReCure-React

This repository was created for a hackathon and provides a minimal setup for a React project. It leverages Vite for a fast development experience and includes ESLint rules to help maintain code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development.
- **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

## Project Structure (Assumed based on typical Vite/React setup)

The project likely follows a standard React application structure, which generally includes:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code, including React components, styles, and assets.
- `public/`: Stores static assets.
- `index.html`: The entry point for the web application.

## Contributors

- Vinayak Pai (Vinayak314) - Responsible for the patient dashboard, eCheckup pages, login page and the backend development.

- Suhaas Nandulamattam (TheDarkKnightSujo) - Responsible for all the other dashboard pages, main landing page, logo and frontend framework.
